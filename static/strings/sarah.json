Out of all of us, your probably the most level headed and I really do model myself after you. I hope that within these next couple years, we can grow our relationship to something even stronger than it was when we were younger.",

	              "My life turned upside down with dad making the decisions that he does, so I realy do want to try to keep the rest of our family strong. Just knowing that you and mom are close and care about the struggles I'm having has made these last few months bearable.",
	              "I'm graduating soon, and I have no better idea of what to do now than a few years ago, but I'm excited to figure all that out with my family by my side.",
