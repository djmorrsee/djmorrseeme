	              "These last few years have definitely been the hardest of my life, and you've been the only one by my side trying to keep me sane, and for that I'm so greatful. There were times I was close to wanting to give up on school and the family and just try and restabalize on my own, but I quickly realized how useless I am without my mom.",
	              "All of my relationships have changed lately, but I can happily say that you and I are growing closer and stronger as we go through this all together. I hope that within the next year or two, I'll really be able to get a footing in life and maybe be able to take care of you instead. I love you so much mom, thanks again for everything that you do to keep me happy, none of it goes unappreciated.",
