	              "These last few years have been a ridiculous roller coaster for us all, and my life has admittedly turned upside down. We are all trying to figure out how to live life with all this new craziness, and the only thing keeping me from losing it are you, mom and Sarah. ",
	              "You are still my family and I love you three more than anything. I never want to lose these relationships as I've lost some others. I'm so excited for the next few years; I'll be graduating with a fancy engineering degree, and hopefully finding a place for myself in life. As this happens, I want nothing more than to share my experiences with you.",
